## Features Left to Implement

 - An easy and simple website you can get everything you want easily

**Technologies Used**

 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>
 
    * HTML5 worked for the structure of the site
and to link images and videos shown on the site.

* <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS3">CSS3</a>
   * Css3 is used to make website design and to be responsive to
    all types of devices

 * <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(Framework)/"> Bootstrap </a>
   * I used Bootstrap to give my project a simple,
     responsive layout
* <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery">JQuery</a>

  * Jquery is used to handle html and css data to save time

## Responsive Web Design
I used a variety of methods to ensure the responsiveness of my website.
These included:
* <a href="https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Mobile_First"> Mobile First Design </a>
  * Mobile First Design is a fundamental part of designing for a multi screen world. I build this website with mobile space,
    functionality and utility as first priority.
* <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
  * I used the Bootstrap Framework to create tried and trusted sleek,
   responsive elements. For example, Bootstrap makes it simple to implement stylish
   a collapsible navbar which responds to screen size:
  
#### Uncollapsed navabr on large screen

#### Collapsed navbar on small screen

* Media Queries
  * I spent a lot of time writing and re-writing Media Queries to optimize t
   he responsiveness of my website based on screen size. It can be a meticulous and tiring process,
   but is more than worth it to have that perfect resize. Font sizes, relatively positioned elements, 
   margins, heights and text alignments all caused trouble in keeping the flow of the website
   consistent 
   on resizes and required Media Queries to iron out the kinnks.

#### Media Page with a width of 731px

**Testing:**
I used a variety of methods to test the responsiveness of my website. These included:

**Contact form:**

   - This is an empty form test
   ![picture](https://d.top4top.net/p_1011n3e5n1.png)

   - Send a form to the wrong email address

   - Send a message without writing a comment
     ![picture](https://e.top4top.net/p_1011g4dtk1.png)

   - Full message data input

 * <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode">Firefox Responsive Design Mode</a>
   * This was an essential tool to testing the responsiveness of my website, 
    Firefox Responsive Design Mode makes
    it fast and effortless to switch between screen sizes and devices.

* Blisk
  * A browser for web developers, Blisk, comes prepacked with fully emulated phones and tablets.
   It shows real time changes to files so I could see exactly how the changes
   to my code were affecting my site.

* Testing In Different Environments
  * There is no simulator that could replace simply testing my website in as many 
   environments as possible. Using as many different browsers and devices as I could 
   get my hands on was key to weening out design flaws. Testing in Different Environments
   was a integral part of guaranteeing my website functions 
   correctly for every User.

  * I also told my site input and the result was positive as shown above. It w
  orks perfectly in all entries. I tried to send an empty message and tried to send 
  fake email and tried not to write it. All these tests passed successfully.

  ### Deployment
