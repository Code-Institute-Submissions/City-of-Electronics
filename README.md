# City of Electronics


 <a href="about.html">City of Electronics</a> Is a fast and lightweight web server for all systems.
Designed to be scalable with low memory consumption and CPU consumption,
it is the ideal solution for slow hardware environments and high productivity environments.

Besides the common features as HTTP server, it expose a flexible C API which aims to behave as a fully HTTP development framework,

**Tech Used**

 * <a href>AngularJS</a>
   * I AngularJS to bind data to the view,
handle page routing, create directives and
use services to organize code and share it accross the website.
 * <a href> Bootstrap </a>
   * I used Bootstrap to give my project a simple,
     responsive layout
* <a href>npm</a>
  * I used npm to help manage some of the dependencies 
   in my website
* <a href>bower</a>
  * Bower is used to manage the installation of libraries 
    and frameworks
## Responsive Web Design
I used a variety of methods to ensure the responsiveness of my website.
These included:
* Mobile First Design
  * Mobile First Design is a fundamental part of designing for a multi screen world. I build this website with mobile space,
    functionality and utility as first priority.
* <a href>Bootstrap</a>
  * I used the Bootstrap Framework to create tried and trusted sleek, responsive elements. For example, Bootstrap makes it simple to implement stylish a collapsible navbar which responds to screen size:
  
#### Uncollapsed navabr on large screen

#### Collapsed navbar on small screen

* Media Queries
  * I spent a lot of time writing and re-writing Media Queries to optimize t
   he responsiveness of my website based on screen size. It can be a meticulous and tiring process,
   but is more than worth it to have that perfect resize. Font sizes, relatively positioned elements, 
   margins, heights and text alignments all caused trouble in keeping the flow of the website
   consistent 
   on resizes and required Media Queries to iron out the kinnks.

**Testing**

I used a variety of methods to test the responsiveness of my website. These included:

 * <a href>Firefox Responsive Design Mode</a>
   * This was an essential tool to testing the responsiveness of my website, 
    Firefox Responsive Design Mode makes
    it fast and effortless to switch between screen sizes and devices.

* Blisk
  * A browser for web developers, Blisk, comes prepacked with fully emulated phones and tablets.
   It shows real time changes to files so I could see exactly how the changes
   to my code were affecting my site.

* Testing In Different Environments
  * There is no simulator that could replace simply testing my website in as many 
   environments as possible. Using as many different browsers and devices as I could 
   get my hands on was key to weening out design flaws. Testing in Different Environments
   was a integral part of guaranteeing my website functions 
   correctly for every User.

  **Deployment**
  
  The project was posted on a github hosted system and this is
  my induction name (https://github.com/albeeralkhawri)
